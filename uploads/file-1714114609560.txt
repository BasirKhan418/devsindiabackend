In the face of the devastating rise in climate-induced disasters, Kartavya is more than just a projectâ€”it's a heartfelt response to a world in desperate need of compassion and support. Picture the fear and vulnerability of being caught in a disaster, desperately seeking aid, not knowing where to turn. Kartavya was born from the pain of witnessing this helplessness and the burning desire to make a difference
What it does
The platform's core functions include disaster preparedness, early warning systems, and climate resilience strategies.
How we built it
MongoDB, Expressjs, Nodejs, Reactjs
Tailwind CSS, JSX
Challenges we ran into
Coming up with the ideas, finally came up with it just a night before.
It was challenging for us to use Auth0 and geolocation API for the first time.
We were about to use generative AI, and open AI APIs but due to the Quota limit, we just built a static model of it.
Accomplishments that we're proud of
Making this whole project work well.
Successfully implemented both Auth0 and Geolocator.
Sending mails using Mailtrap.
What we learned
Teamwork
Nodemailer and Auth0
Live updates on site and, Postman
What's next for Kartavya
Use of authorized APIs of government sites.
Integrating AI chatbot for better reach.
